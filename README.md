## Information

Welcome to Cody Clark Photography - This site is meant to be a showcase of freelance and professional photography projects. Over the last decade I have been a concert, media, wedding, portrait, and landscape photographer and wanted to create a gallery with favorites. This was a great opportunity to create a fullstack application with meaning for me. I will be continuously developing this application with new technologies and pictures as my collection of stills and creativity grows.

## Technologies Used

MongoDB

Express

React

Node.js

Tailwind CSS

## Issues and Resolutions

The goal of this project was to introduce a new technology to my stack so that I could keep learning and progressing as a developer and maintain a personal project. The technology I chose was Tailwind CSS. Tailwind interested me for a long time its simplicity and efficiency come with the minor downside of an initial installation process and learning additional syntax. The trickiest part was referencing Tailwind CSS keyword to ensure I was styling everything accordingly. After a few days the main styles start to become secondhand and then its about referencing which other styles for specific details needed. Tailwind is something I will include in various projects to come.

## Future Steps

This gallery website will progress into a store to sell photography prints of the stills I have captured. I will continue to optimize the site with mobile queries, css polishing and stripe/square integration.
