## Information

Welcome to Cody Clark Photography - This site is meant to be a showcase of freelance and professional photography projects. Over the last decade I have been a concert, media, wedding, portrait, and landscape photographer and wanted to create a gallery with favorites. This was a great opportunity to create a fullstack application with meaning for me. I will be continuously developing this application with new technologies and pictures as my collection of stills and creativity grows.
